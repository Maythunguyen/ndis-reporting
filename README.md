# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**Additional Tips:**

.gitignore: Ensure your .gitignore file excludes node_modules/ to prevent committing dependencies. This is standard practice in React-Vite projects.
Formatting: Use markdown syntax for clarity and readability.
Examples: Provide code snippets or screenshots to illustrate usage.
